# Tigerbook V2: An Extensive Student Directory Framework For Princeton University

### Abstract

This paper details the design and implementation of Tigerbook V2, an extensive student directory framework designed specifically for Princeton University. Building on the features of the original Tigerbook but with emphasis on privacy, this platform aggregates opt-in information
from undergraduate students about their hometowns, current cities, extra-curriculars, interests,
and research, providing a comprehensive resource for finding and connecting with other students
who share similar backgrounds and interests. The directory has a user-friendly interface and is
easy-to-navigate, with robust search tools that enable students to filter results based on a variety of
criteria to find profile of other students. While the directory is only for Princeton undergraduates,
there is the potential to extend the platform to include Princeton alumni and graduate students in
the near future. Overall, Tigerbook V2 aims to foster a stronger sense of community among students
and to start conversation among each other.
